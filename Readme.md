# OnPoint Weather Forecast - Machine Learning Pipeline

## ABOUT THE DATASET

OnPoint Weather is a global weather dataset for business available for any lat/lon point and geographic area such as ZIP codes. OnPoint Weather provides a continuum of hourly and daily weather from the year 2000 to current time and a forward forecast of 45 days.
Weather has a significant impact on businesses and accounts for hundreds of billions in lost revenue annually. OnPoint Weather allows businesses to quantify weather impacts and develop strategies to optimize for weather to improve business performance.

## MOTIVE

OnPoint Climatology provides hourly and daily weather statistics which can be used to determine ‘departures from normal’ and to provide climatological guidance of expected weather for any location at any point in time. The group is trying to learn the underlying cause behind why weather forecasts go wrong and gain a logistical insight about how weather forecasting companies undergo billions of dollars in loss every year.

## TARGET AUDIENCE

Although this project will be primarily focused on analysis/research on the data, it will try to shed some light on the margin of error in weather forecast and the suggested correction measures. We will use statistics within the dataset to determine the causality in weather forecast errors. In other words, anyone with an interest in weather forecasts will serve as our target audience.

## DOMAIN: Analysis/Forecasting

## Analysis Tool: BigQuery

## DATA PREPROCESSING

We are using Weather Source's OnPoint Climatology Data, which is essentially the statistics of weather over time. Climatology data can be useful in two ways - It allows users to compare weather to what should be ‘normal’ weather for a place and time. This allows for finding 'Anomalies' in the weather, that is, whether parameters like Temperature, Humidity, Air Pressure etc are 'Departing from Normal' . Often it’s the departure from normal that has the biggest influence on consumers and the greater the departure from normal the greater it's effect on customers and consequently, the Business.
For this Project, we are considering United States climatology data for Hourly and Daily weather statistics.

For this project we are using data from the year 2016 which is available on GCP.
For this task we have implemented some sample queries to illustrate the depth of the dataset. You can view the results for a New York weather forecast in the ./results-20200407-131226.csv file

## RESEARCH QUESTION
Why do weather forecasts go wrong? We try to gain a logistical insight into how forecasting organizations undergo billions of dollars in loss every year.

## REPORT

The report will be generated by ingesting the data into Google Cloud and we will be using Google Data Studio for EDA. Two interactive dashboards will be delivered along with a brief writeup of our process.
